### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Front-End Developer, currently busy-coding on React/Typescript full-time at a company for a startup, the rest of my time I am getting ready for a free self-taught education in Computer Science at [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), more metadata on my progress could be found here [my-self-education-in-computer-science](https://github.com/androranogajec/my-self-education-in-computer-science/tree/master).
